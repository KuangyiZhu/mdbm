mdbm-os
=======

MDBM is a super-fast memory-mapped key/value store.

To use the modern buzzwords, it is [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL), and for
many operations, it is [Zero-Copy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-copy).

It is based on an earlier version by Larry McVoy,
then at SGI. That in turn, is based on SDBM by
Ozan Yigit. [wikipedia DBM article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dbm)

Yahoo added significant performance enhancements,
many tools, tests, and comprehensive documentation.
It has been used in production for over a decade, 
for a wide variety of applications, both large and small.

It is being released under the BSD license.
